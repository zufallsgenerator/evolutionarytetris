Evolutionary Tetris
===================
Tetris AI with genetic algorithms, an old university project.
(C) 2005 Christer Byström

The paper (in Swedish) can be found here: http://www.ida.liu.se/~729G50/studentpapper-05/christer-bystrom.pdf

The software can be built as a client optimizing the genes, running in console mode, or as a client using the SDL library.
If you run bin/etetris.exe you can activate the AI by pressin C.
